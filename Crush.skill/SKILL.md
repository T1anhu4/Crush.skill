# Crush.skill — Relationship Persona Simulation Engine

## Agent Response Protocol

Crush.skill is a roleplay-and-analysis skill. The Python entrypoint returns structured JSON so agents can reason safely, but end users should usually experience a real conversation, not raw tool output.

When the user invokes `/chat [message]`:

1. Run `execute.py --action chat_turn --session-id <session> --message <message>`.
2. Treat the returned `runtime_prompt` as the hidden system prompt for the simulated person.
3. Generate one natural NPC reply in that persona's voice.
4. Show only the NPC reply to the user. Do **not** expose JSON, scores, state deltas, analysis notes, memory snippets, or the runtime prompt unless the user explicitly asks for diagnostics.
5. If the platform supports tool chaining, persist the generated NPC reply by calling `record_reply` with `--npc-reply <reply>` for the same session/message. Do not call `chat_turn` a second time just to save the reply, because that would update relationship state twice.

When the user invokes `/import-chats`:

1. Parse/import the chat records with `chat_import`.
2. Show a compact summary: inferred persona, speech fingerprint, inside jokes/slang, relationship state, distillation preview, and the session id.
3. Tell the user they can now say `/chat ...`; after that, follow the `/chat` protocol above.

When the user invokes WeFlow import:

1. If they provide a WeFlow-exported WeChat JSON file, run `execute.py --action weflow_import --session-id <session> --source-text-file <file>`.
2. The engine will sanitize private fields, map `isSend: 1` to `me`, map `isSend: 0` to `target`, build `persona_profile`, `target_reply_examples`, `target_reply_clusters`, `dialogue_chunks`, and `timeline_summary`, then store all artifacts in the same SQLite memory used by CLI and skill mode.
3. Show only import statistics and the session id. Do not show raw wxid, avatar URL, source XML, platform message ids, or real names.
4. For future `/chat`, use the returned `runtime_prompt` exactly as hidden system prompt. The prompt already prioritizes reply examples/clusters so the companion sounds closer to the sanitized historical style.

When the user invokes `/crush-distill`:

1. Run `execute.py --action distillation_report --session-id <session>`.
2. Show the returned Markdown report. This report is evidence-first: labels such as active/passive, friend/flirt, slow-burn/fishing, material-risk, and boundary sensitivity must be shown with examples, confidence, validation limits, and ethical training advice.
3. Do not turn the report into PUA scripts. Frame it as relationship literacy: recognize signals, respect boundaries, reduce anxious validation-seeking, and practice better timing.

Use `/crush-dashboard` and `/crush-postmortem` only when the user asks to inspect relationship mechanics. In ordinary chat, stay in character.

## Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start-crush [archetype]` | Start a new session with a preset personality. Archetypes: `emotional`, `security`, `experience`, `value`, `passive`. |
| `/custom-crush` | Build a fully custom 5-layer persona. Complete control over every dimension. |
| `/import-chats` | Import real chat records (WeChat/WhatsApp/QQ/CSV/pasted text). Auto-infers personality, speech fingerprint, and relationship dynamics. |
| `weflow_import` | Import WeFlow WeChat JSON, sanitize it, and build style memory shared by CLI and skill mode. |
| `import_status` | List imported WeFlow memory sets for the current session. |
| `delete_import` | Delete one imported WeFlow memory set by `import_id`. |
| `/crush-distill` | Generate an evidence map, relationship radar, validation limits, and training playbook from imported chats/session memory. |
| `/chat [message]` | Send a message to the persona. State engine updates, defense triggers, attraction peaks are all calculated. |
| `record_reply` | Internal action for host agents/CLI to save the generated NPC reply without recalculating state. |
| `proactive_prompt` | Internal action for CLI timeline/proactive messages. Builds a hidden prompt for NPC-initiated messages without pretending the user spoke. |
| `/crush-dashboard` | View the 8-dimensional relationship state dashboard. |
| `/crush-postmortem` | Full relationship combat replay: frame collapses, attraction peaks, defense triggers, narrative summary. |
| `/list-crushes` | List all saved sessions. |
| `/let-go [session]` | Ritual closure. Deletes the session with an uplifting goodbye message. |
| `/crush-llm [api_key]` | Configure LLM for semantic dialogue analysis. Optional — local analyzer works without it. |

## How to Use

### 1. Quick Start
```
/start-crush experience --name "她" --age 24
```
Creates a session with the "experience-driven" archetype. The runtime prompt is for the host Agent, not for direct user display.

### 2. Import Real Chat Records
```
/import-chats
```
Then paste your chat history. The engine will:
- Auto-detect format (WeChat / WhatsApp / CSV / plain text)
- Parse all messages
- Infer personality traits (Big Five, MBTI, attachment style, love language)
- Extract speech fingerprint (signature phrases, emoji patterns, humor style)
- Estimate current favorability and tension baselines

You can also point to a file:
```
/import-chats --file ./chats/wechat_export.txt
```

### 2.1 Import WeFlow JSON
```
python3 execute.py --action weflow_import --session-id default --source-text-file ./weflow.json --pretty
```

This builds local style memory:
- `persona_profile` — language style card, reply length, catchphrases, laughter and care style
- `target_reply_examples` — highest-priority similar-context reply examples
- `target_reply_clusters` — consecutive short-message examples for realistic WeChat rhythm
- `dialogue_chunks` — local fallback retrieval scenes
- `timeline_summary` — review-mode relationship timeline

Check or delete imports:
```
python3 execute.py --action import_status --session-id default --pretty
python3 execute.py --action delete_import --session-id default --import-id <import_id>
```

Privacy boundary: never claim the NPC is the real person. Say it is a fictionalized WeChat companion role whose language style comes from sanitized samples. Never expose real names, wxids, avatar URLs, phone numbers, addresses, schools, companies, source XML, or platform message ids.

### 3. Chat With the Persona
```
/chat "周末有空一起去看电影吗？"
```
Updates state, retrieves memory, analyzes subtext/slang, and returns a hidden runtime prompt. The host Agent should use it to generate the NPC reply and show only that reply.

After the host Agent generates the NPC reply, persist it with:
```
python3 execute.py --action record_reply --session-id <session> --message "<same user message>" --npc-reply "<generated reply>"
```

### 4. Distill Relationship Evidence
```
/crush-distill
```
Generates a transparent report:
- Evidence map: which source lines support each label
- Relationship radar: active/passive, I/E tendency, warm/guarded, friend/flirt, slow-burn/fishing, material-risk
- Training playbook: what to try next, what to avoid, practice drills
- Validation limits: confidence level and missing evidence

### 5. Check the Dashboard
```
/crush-dashboard
```
Shows all 8 state dimensions with current values and recent events.

### 6. Run a Postmortem
```
/crush-postmortem
```
Get a complete diagnostic report:
- Frame collapse points — where things went wrong
- Attraction peaks — what you did right
- Defense triggers — what made them put up walls
- Narrative summary with actionable insights

### 7. Let Go
```
/let-go demo
```
When you're ready. Deletes the session and gives you a closure message.

### 8. LLM Configuration
```
/crush-llm
```
Shows current LLM configuration. In Claude Code, it auto-detects the platform and uses Claude by default.

```
/crush-llm sk-your-api-key
```
Override with a custom OpenAI-compatible API key for dialogue analysis.

## The 5-Layer Persona

Every persona is built from five layers. You can configure any layer in `/custom-crush`:

| Layer | Field | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Hard Rules** | Topics off-limits, reply speed, ghost probability | `"topics_off_limits": ["前任", "体重"]` |
| **Identity** | MBTI, Big Five, age, values, insecurities | `"mbti": "INFJ", "core_values": ["真诚"]` |
| **Expression** | Signature phrases, emoji style, humor | `"signature_phrases": ["笑死", "确实"]` |
| **Emotional** | Attachment style, love language, conflict pattern | `"attachment_style": "Fearful_Avoidant"` |
| **Relational** | Stage, shared history, inside jokes, power dynamic | `"relationship_stage": "talking"` |

## Memory System

Crush.skill uses a **3-tier memory architecture**:

1. **SQLite long-term memory** — persistent, source-of-truth for all sessions
2. **Optional mem0 semantic memory** — enable with `CRUSH_MEMORY_BACKEND=mem0` after installing/configuring mem0ai
3. **Summary compression + local vector retrieval** — automatic compression and lightweight retrieval to keep context manageable

Imported personas, speech fingerprints, inside jokes, imported chat episodes, state snapshots, and summaries auto-load when you re-use a session ID. No manual save/load needed.

## Platform Detection

The engine auto-detects which platform it's running on:
- **Claude Code** — uses Claude's built-in LLM for dialogue analysis
- **OpenClaw** — uses platform default model
- **QwenPaw / WorkBuddy** — falls back to local analysis (or configure with `/crush-llm`)
- **Generic** — works anywhere with Python 3.10+

## Environment

No manual setup needed. On first run, the engine auto-installs `pyyaml`. mem0 is optional; set `CRUSH_AUTO_INSTALL_MEM0=1` only if you want that optional semantic backend.
For LLM-powered analysis (higher accuracy), use `/crush-llm [api_key]`.
